# FloatingWind
Codes and models to calculate hydrodynamic coefficients of semisubmersible structures, and perform dynamic analysis of the system

## Version control of floaters

### submerged_floater_v4: 

The arm length is increased to 0.5m, the central column is left untouched, the diameter of the spar buoys is 0.125m. The thickness of the arm is 0.002m and the submerged level is 0.142m.

### submerged_floater_v5

The version 4 is modified to include heave plates of 0.1m radius

### submerged_floater_v6

The arm length is reduced to 0.25m. The spar radius is reduced to 0.0375m, and the heave plate radius accordingly to 0.5m.
